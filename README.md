libSickbeard-PHP
================

PHP Library wrapping the Sickbeard API.

Features:

- Completely wraps most of the normal functions of the Sickbeard API. If something does not work correctly, please open an issue ticket and let me know.

- Returns Sickbeard API result in the form of an associative array, please see the Sickbeard API listing for field names however.



Once again. If you find a bug in the code, or have some feature you want implemented, please let me know and I'll see what I can do. If you have a patch for this that you want to add, please leave it for me in the issues section.

This project is standalone. It does not have any extra files or helper libraries with it.
